## Introduction to Physics and We

Welcome to **Physics and We**. 
Physics and We is an  educational campâ€¤ Within the framework of the camp, a digital spectrometer will be designed and prepared, which will make it possible to study the composition of different liquids.


## Introduction to this project

This project provides tools for analyzing spectrometric data, including:

- Reading and visualizing spectral data.
- Converting spectral intensities into vectors and making them orthogonal.
- Projecting the intensity vector of the unknown material onto the vector subspace of the orthogonal vectors.
- Reversing orthogonal vectors to determine the ratio of mixed substances.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Chalyan/Physics_and_We.git
cd Physics_and_We/
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_loop.py
```

## Usage

### Data Input

Spectrometric data should be provided in files containing wavelength and intensity information. The data files should be in a format readable by Python (e.g., CSV).

### Data Visualization

By plotting the CSV file in Python, you can create graphs for individual measurements or for all the measurements combined, as shown below:

### Vector Conversion and Subspace Creation

This code can convert intensity measurements into vectors, simplify them using orthogonalization and create vector subspace using the orthogonal vectors

### Material Identification

To identify an unknown material code projects the given intensity vector onto the vector subspace:
